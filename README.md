This is a fork of http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/twitter-for-wordpress/trunk which doesn't seem to be maintained any longer and stopped to work on one of my wordpress instances so I had to fix an url for readin twitter messages.

I guess I'm going to maintain the plugin for now as I use it on my sites since it's simple and does exactly what I need.

Fell free to fork or send pull requests!
